# GoodForm - Plataforma de Gestión de Formularios

## Overview
GoodForm is a comprehensive web platform for form management, supporting both visual drag-and-drop and code-based (HTML/CSS/JS) form builders. It features a robust authentication system, granular permissions, data export to Excel, real-time analytics dashboards, and support for public/private forms. The platform is designed with a dual SaaS and Auto-Host deployment model, including a licensing system. Its primary purpose is to provide a flexible and powerful tool for users to create, deploy, and manage various types of forms and analyze their responses, offering a professional and business-oriented user experience with a focus on ease of use and powerful customization options.

## User Preferences
- All texts should be in Spanish.
- Use `data-testid` on all interactive elements.
- Prefer Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Utilize reusable Shadcn/UI components.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, leveraging Shadcn/UI with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design. The aesthetic is inspired by Material Design 3 and Linear, aiming for a professional and business-oriented look. Application appearance (appName, logo, favicon, primary color) is highly customizable via an admin configuration page with real-time previews.

### Technical Implementations
- **Dual Form Builder**: Supports both visual drag-and-drop and code-based (HTML/CSS/JS) form creation with a live editor and real-time preview, including auto-saving.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Email/password authentication using Passport-local with `scrypt` hashing. Role-based access control (super_admin, admin_auto_host, visualizador_auto_host, cliente_saas) and granular form-level permissions (Owner, Editor, Viewer).
- **Data Export**: Exports form responses to Excel using ExcelJS.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Customizable charts (bar, line, pie, area, scatter) powered by Recharts, supporting various aggregation types and cross-analysis for both visual and code-based forms. Features an interactive ChartBuilder UI and API for chart management.
- **AI Integration**: Supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Deepseek) configured via an admin page. Features an AI Analyst Agent integrated into form responses for natural language data analysis, automatic chart creation/editing/deletion via function calls, and persistent chat history. API keys are securely stored encrypted in PostgreSQL.
- **SMTP Email Configuration**: Secure SMTP server configuration for email notifications, accessible to Super Admin and Admin Auto-host roles. Credentials are encrypted and stored in PostgreSQL.
- **Password Recovery System**: Implements a complete forgot password and reset password flow with email notifications, secure token management, and robust security features.
- **Usage Reports**: Provides application usage analytics (e.g., login activity, password resets) for Super Admin and Admin Auto-host roles, displayed via Recharts.
- **Auto-saving**: Implemented in the form builder with debounce for title and description.
- **Database Initialization**: Automatic table creation and initial data seeding on first application start.
- **Validation**: Frontend validation with React Hook Form and Zod; backend validation for permissions and data integrity.

### Feature Specifications
- **Deployment Modes**:
    - **SaaS (default)**: Public registration enabled, full features, super-admin manages licenses for Auto-Host instances.
    - **Auto-Host**: Requires initial setup wizard, public registration blocked, license key required for unlimited forms (5-form limit without).
- **Licensing System**: Licenses are validated daily online against the SaaS instance, with a 3-day grace period for connectivity issues.
- **Configurable Application Settings**: Admins can customize application name, logo URL, favicon URL, and primary color with real-time feedback.

### System Design Choices
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API.
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, React Query for server state management, Wouter for routing.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe schema definition and querying. All data, including sessions, is persisted in PostgreSQL.
- **Security**: Passwords hashed with scrypt, httpOnly session cookies, robust backend role/permission validation, and input sanitization.
